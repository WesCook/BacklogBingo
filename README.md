# Tildes Backlog Bingo

Created for the [Tildes Backlog Burner event](https://tildes.net/~games/1brk/announcing_the_tildes_backlog_burner_event_for_2023_shrink_your_unplayed_games_list_this_november#comments), this tool will accept a list of game backlog ideas and generate a unique bingo card.  For example, a square might include "a game in a genre you don't normally play".
