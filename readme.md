# Tildes Backlog Bingo

Created for the [Tildes Backlog Burner event](https://tildes.net/~games/1brk/announcing_the_tildes_backlog_burner_event_for_2023_shrink_your_unplayed_games_list_this_november#comments), this tool will accept a list of game backlog ideas and generate a unique bingo card.  For example, a square might include "a game in a genre you don't normally play".

The app allows you to select a number of possible challenges, and then generates a unique bingo card for you in Markdown format.

[Open the web app](https://wescook.ca/TildesBacklogBingo/) to get started.
